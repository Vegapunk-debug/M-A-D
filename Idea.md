## Problem Statement
Many people have valuable skills (like coding, cooking, photography, etc.) but lack access to affordable learning resources for other skills they want to acquire. Current platforms often require payment, making skill development less accessible.

---

## Proposed Solution / Idea
A React Native mobile app where users can list the skills they can teach and the skills they want to learn. The app matches users with compatible skill exchange partners, enabling free or barter-based learning.

---

## Key Features
- User profiles with skills they can teach & want to learn  
- AI-based matching system for finding ideal skill partners  
- In-app chat & scheduling for lessons  
- Rating & feedback system for trust-building  
- Skill badges & progress tracking  
- Option for both online and offline learning meetups  

---

## Target Users / Audience
Students, freelancers, hobbyists, and anyone who wants to learn or share skills without monetary barriers.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native, React Navigation  
- **Backend:** Firebase / Node.js with Express  
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore / MongoDB  
- **Chat System:** Firebase Realtime Database or Socket.io  
- **AI Matching:** TensorFlow.js / Custom recommendation logic  

---

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional skill exchange platform that encourages peer-to-peer learning and builds communities based on knowledge sharing.

---

## Timeline
- **Week 1–2:** UI/UX design & profile management  
- **Week 3–4:** Skill listing & matching system  
- **Week 5:** Chat & scheduling features  
- **Week 6:** Rating, badges & progress tracking  
- **Week 7:** Testing, security enhancements & deployment  

---

## Additional Notes
The app could later introduce group skill sessions, live workshops, and integration with Google Calendar for automated scheduling.
